  "readme": "### TextBelt\nTextBelt (http://textbelt.com) is a REST API that sends outgoing SMS. It is available as a public service or as an internally self-hosted server.\n\nTextbelt uses carrier-specific gateways to deliver your text messages for free, and without ads.  The service is fairly reliable and has sent over 1 million texts.\n\nSend a text with a simple POST request:\n\n```sh\n$ curl -X POST http://textbelt.com/text \\\n   -d number=5551234567 \\\n   -d \"message=I sent this message for free with textbelt.com\"\n```\n\n`number` and `message` parameters are required.\n\n### Success and Failure\nSample success:\n\n```json\n{\"success\":true}\n```\n\nNote that success means that the message was sent to Textbelt's list of providers.  We can't guarantee delivery on your network.\n\nSample failure:\n\n```json\n{\"success\":false,\"message\":\"Exceeded quota for this phone number.\"}\n```\n\n### Usage as a module\n\nThough this repository contains an express server so you may run your own\ninstance of the web app, you may also use it to send text messages in your\nproject. The only requirement is unix/posix `sendmail`, used to forward the message.\n\nFor example, to send a text using the default settings:\n\n```js\nvar text = require('textbelt');\n\ntext.send('9491234567', 'A sample text message!', undefined, function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log(err);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou can also supply a region (valid choices are `us`, `intl`, or `canada`)\n\n```js\nvar text = require('textbelt');\n\n// Canada\ntext.send('9491234567', 'A sample text message!', 'canada', function(err) {\n...\n});\n\n// International\ntext.send('1119491234567', 'Bonjour!', 'intl', function(err) {\n...\n});\n```\n\n### Usage as a standalone server\n\nTextbelt can be run as a standalone server with: `node server/app.js`.  Be sure to install dependencies first with `npm install`. This project also relies on redis. To install redis locally, please see the [redis documentation](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart). Before launching the app, ensure redis is running on port 6379 with `redis-server`.\n\nTextbelt also depends on a local installation of `mutt`, the email client (http://www.mutt.org/).  On Linux (Ubuntu), you can `sudo apt-get install mutt`.  On macs, you can `brew install mutt`.\n\nBy default, the server listens on port 9090 and is configured to accept traffic from a reverse proxy or load balancer such as nginx.  To enable accurate IP rate limiting, the reverse proxy should be configured to set the `X-Real-IP` header.\n\nDon't forget to set `fromAddress` in `lib/text.js` to the email address you want to send from.\n\n### Canadian and International endpoints\n\nThe /text endpoint supports U.S. phone numbers (and parts of Canada).\n\nFor Canadian texts, curl `http://textbelt.com/canada`.\n\nFor international texts, curl `http://textbelt.com/intl`.\n\nCanadian and international support may not be complete.  Refer to the list of supported carriers.\n\n### Textbelt Clients\n\n  * ruby - [djds23/textbelt-gem](https://github.com/djds23/textbelt-gem)\n  * go - [dietsche/textbelt](https://github.com/dietsche/textbelt)\n  * node.js - [minond/textbelt](https://github.com/minond/textbelt), [ajay-gandhi/textbelt](https://github.com/ajay-gandhi/textbelt), [soondobu/mtextbelt](https://github.com/soondobu/mtextbelt)\n  * php - [ctrlaltdylan/courier](https://github.com/ctrlaltdylan/courier), [securingsincity/phpsms](https://github.com/securingsincity/phpsms)\n  * bash - [cfalk/MessageMe](https://github.com/cfalk/MessageMe)\n  * html/js webpage - [mLuby/SMS](https://github.com/mLuby/SMS)\n  * Browser extension - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textbelter/clciehobfheendclpnmbgbalelignpoa), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/textbelter/), [Safari](https://github.com/daluu/textbelt-clients/raw/master/textbelter.safariextz), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/textbelter/?display=en)\n  * Windows Phone - [TextBelter](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/textbelter/9nblggh1z2dg)\n  * [SendSMS Mac App](https://itunes.apple.com/app/sendsms/id584131262?mt=12)\n  * [OSX dashboard widget](https://github.com/daluu/textbelt-clients/releases/download/1.0/TextBelter.wdgt.zip)\n  * [Windows 7/Vista gadget](https://github.com/daluu/textbelt-clients/releases/download/1.0/textbelter.gadget.zip)\n\n\n### Notes and Limitations\n\n * Some carriers are picky about which messages they deliver. A \"success\" response from Textbelt means that your message was given to the carrier.\n\n *  IP addresses are limited to 75 texts per day.  Phone numbers are limited to 3 texts every 3 minutes.  If you need increased limits, please contact admin@textbelt.com.\n\n *  Some carriers may deliver text messages from \"txt@textbelt.com\"\n\n *  Supported U.S. carriers: Alltel, Ameritech, AT&T Wireless, Boost, CellularOne, Cingular, Edge Wireless, Nex-Tech Wireless, Project Fi, Sprint PCS, Telus Mobility, T-Mobile, Metro PCS, Nextel, O2, Orange, Qwest, Rogers Wireless, Ting, US Cellular, Verizon, Virgin Mobile.\n\n *  Supported U.S. and Canadian carriers (/canada):  3 River Wireless, ACS Wireless, AT&T, Alltel, BPL Mobile, Bell Canada, Bell Mobility, Bell Mobility (Canada), Blue Sky Frog, Bluegrass Cellular, Boost Mobile, Carolina West Wireless, Cellular One, Cellular South, Centennial Wireless, CenturyTel, Cingular (Now AT&T), Clearnet, Comcast, Corr Wireless Communications, Dobson, Edge Wireless, Fido, Golden Telecom, Helio, Houston Cellular, Idea Cellular, Illinois Valley Cellular, Inland Cellular Telephone, MCI, MTS, Metro PCS, Metrocall, Metrocall 2-way, Microcell, Midwest Wireless, Mobilcomm, Nextel, OnlineBeep, PCS One, President's Choice, Public Service Cellular, Qwest, Republic Wireless, Rogers AT&T Wireless, Rogers Canada, Satellink, Solo Mobile, Southwestern Bell, Sprint, Sumcom, Surewest Communicaitons, T-Mobile, Telus, Tracfone, Triton, US Cellular, US West, Unicel, Verizon, Virgin Mobile, Virgin Mobile Canada, West Central Wireless, Western Wireless\n\n *  Supported international carriers (/intl):  Chennai RPG Cellular, Chennai Skycell / Airtel, Comviq, DT T-Mobile, Delhi Aritel, Delhi Hutch, Dutchtone / Orange-NL, EMT, Escotel, German T-Mobile, Goa BPLMobil, Golden Telecom, Gujarat Celforce, JSM Tele-Page, Kerala Escotel, Kolkata Airtel, Kyivstar, LMT, Lauttamus Communication, Maharashtra BPL Mobile, Maharashtra Idea Cellular, Manitoba Telecom Systems, Meteor, MiWorld, Mobileone, Mobilfone, Mobility Bermuda, Mobistar Belgium, Mobitel Tanzania, Mobtel Srbija, Movistar, Mumbai BPL Mobile, Netcom, Ntelos, O2, O2 (M-mail), One Connect Austria, OnlineBeep, Optus Mobile, Orange, Orange Mumbai, Orange NL / Dutchtone, Oskar, P&T Luxembourg, Personal Communication, Pondicherry BPL Mobile, Primtel, SCS-900, SFR France, Safaricom, Satelindo GSM, Simple Freedom, Smart Telecom, Southern LINC, Sunrise Mobile, Surewest Communications, Swisscom, Telcel Mexico, T-Mobile Austria, T-Mobile Germany, T-Mobile UK, TIM, TSR Wireless, Tamil Nadu BPL Mobile, Tele2 Latvia, Telefonica Movistar, Telenor, Teletouch, Telia Denmark, UMC, Uraltel, Uttar Pradesh Escotel, Vessotel, Vodafone Italy, Vodafone Japan, Vodafone UK, Wyndtell\n\n### License (MIT)\n\nTextBelt\nCopyright (C) 2012 by Ian Webster\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
